## About

The Pipeline is a software project that simplifies the implementation of machine learning algorithms. It provides a framework where users can easily plug in their own modules and leverage the power of various machine learning techniques.

The goal of this pipeline is to streamline the development process for running a variety of pre-trained models. By offering a flexible architecture, users can seamlessly integrate their custom modules, including image detection, facial recognition, and natural language processing. This allows developers to focus on the specific tasks of their machine learning projects without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.


## Features
- **Modularity**: The pipeline is designed to support the integration of diverse machine learning algorithms and components. Users can simply plug in their own modules and configure the pipeline to orchestrate the data flow and processing.
- **Ease of Use**: The intuitive module interface and comprehensive documentation make it easy for users to understand and leverage the pipeline. A user who adds a module only needs to adjust the fields of their provided proto message and the pipeline framework handles the rest.
- **Scalability**: The pipeline is built to handle multiple processors at once, giving the user the ability to run multiple modules in a single run.


## Installation

Prerequisites: CMake 3.25.1, gcc 12.2.0
Once you have the prerequisites installed, there is a setup script that you will need to run to install the remaining dependencies. This installation script has been test on debian systems, but not on redhat.

```bash
# Installation commands
$ git clone https://github.com/myrickb/Pipeline.git
$ cd Pipeline/scripts/
$ ./setup.sh
```


## <div id="usage"/>Usage
This section will provide the user with information regarding basic usage of the pipeline. For this section, we will be using pre-exisiting example modules that don't really do anything meaningful.
